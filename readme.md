# 3. Notes
The project is done with my own CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript using JQuery. Bootstrap and JQuery libraries are added by using the .css and .js files from their official webpage. This was made so the download of .css and .js files was not necessary.
The images and icons used are all free licensed.

Consider that this code was develop with Google Chrome, the best view should be from that browser.
